### What I learned

Since 2017 I built my first HTML Website and took a long while to come back for HTML & CSS, I learned some new content I haven't had any experience with years ago and still to explore some others.

### Continued development

The use of mobile first structures in projects with vh, em, rem. Knowing more of the basic concepts so I can solve problems in codes in the future.
